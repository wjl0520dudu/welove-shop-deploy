"""Low-cost, auditable intent-routing helpers.

The main graph uses a conservative three-stage policy:

1. high-certainty deterministic rules;
2. structured LLM routing for unresolved requests;
3. an ``unknown`` clarification fallback for low-confidence output.

Rules intentionally cover only clear cases. Ambiguous, contextual, or mixed
expressions are left to the LLM instead of being forced into a business agent.
